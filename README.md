# REGISTER NUMBER : 212223220107

# Aim:
To demonstrate how diverse prompting techniques across AI platforms can be applied to generate scenario-based project reports by simulating each design stage from ideation to deployment.

# AI Tools Used:
AI Development Platforms: OpenAI API for natural language processing (NLP) and weather report summarization. Data Collection Tools: Weather APIs (OpenWeatherMap API), Google Sheets for data logging. Programming Environment: Python for weather data retrieval, processing, and visualization. Evaluation Tools: Metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-Squared Score (R²), and graphical comparison of predicted vs actual weather parameters.

# PROCEDURE:
A systematic approach leveraging diverse prompting techniques is employed to ensure robust design, user-centered workflows, and accurate, actionable weather insights.

### 3. Prompting Techniques for Each Stage of the Design Process
Stage 1: Requirement Gathering and User Needs Assessment

User Scenario Prompting
Prompt: “You’re organizing a school sports event next weekend. What weather alerts would concern you the most?”

Goal: Identify weather sensitivities like lightning risk, rainfall timing, wind gusts, and temperature spikes.

Straightforward Prompting Prompt: “What are 4 essential weather stats required in a weather app for school administrators?”

Goal: Direct extraction of key parameters like temperature, precipitation chance, air quality, and wind warnings.

# Tabular Format Prompting:
User Type Weather Info Required Decision Support Provided School Principal Air quality, rain forecast Outdoor activity approval Event Planner Wind speed, rainfall timing Tent setup and safety considerations Driver Fog level, visibility Route planning and transport scheduling

Goal: Segment data based on user roles to enhance personalization.

### Preceding Question Prompting
Prompt: “Before planning outdoor logistics, what general weather alerts are most crucial?” Goal: Determine first-glance alert hierarchy such as severe alerts → precipitation → wind.

Stage 2: System Design and Architecture
Technical Scenario Prompting Prompt: “Design a system where weather API calls are optimized to refresh data hourly without performance bottlenecks.” Goal: Push for cache strategies, use of edge servers, and cost-efficient backend logic.

Straightforward Prompting Prompt: “What are the 6 core components of an intelligent weather tracking system?” Goal: Cover system-wide planning including API handler, database, alert engine, forecast engine, UI, and analytics module.

Tabular Format Prompting Module Name Description Suggested Stack API Integrator Connects to real-time weather APIs Python + OpenWeather API Caching Layer Stores frequent calls temporarily Redis Forecast Engine Predictive model for trends Prophet / XGBoost Visualization UI Real-time weather charts and alerts Vue.js / Chart.js Notification Hub Sends weather alerts in real time Twilio / OneSignal Admin Dashboard Monitor usage & API load Django Admin

Goal: Clarify backend and frontend interoperation.

Preceding Question Prompting Prompt: “Before finalizing serverless vs monolith design, what trade-offs in scalability and latency must be reviewed?” Goal: Address architecture decisions based on performance benchmarks.

# Stage 3: Prototype Development
Scenario-Based Workflow Prompting
Prompt: “A tourist opens the app to check weather for three destinations. Outline their journey from input to result.”

Goal: Design user-friendly multi-location search with minimum friction.

### Straightforward Prompting
Prompt: “List the steps for receiving severe weather notifications on the app.”

Goal: Ensure clear notification setup process: Settings → Location → Notification Type → Save.

### Tabular Format Prompting
Step User Action System Response
1 Tap 'Add City' Search screen appears 2 Enter city and select Weather card for that city added 3 Enable notifications Options appear: Alerts / Daily / Custom 4 Save settings Notifications configured

Goal: Break down user flow and expected behavior.

### Preceding Question Prompting
Prompt: “Before the user sees full 7-day forecast, should a highlight of ‘next 24 hours’ be shown?”

Goal: Improve UX by prioritizing near-future insights.

# Stage 4: Testing and Iteration
### Stress Testing Prompting
Prompt: “Simulate a condition where rainfall alerts are sent to 50,000 users simultaneously. What could break?”

Goal: Detect issues in push delivery rate, queuing delays, and notification clustering.

### Straightforward Prompting
Prompt: “Mention 3 common UI issues users face in forecast-heavy apps.”

Goal: Focus on design flaws like overload, poor navigation, and unreadable icons.

### Tabular Format Prompting
Issue Mitigation Strategy API Overload Rate limit & dynamic backoff mechanism Cloud Cost Spikes Schedule-based function triggers UI Lag During Alerts Burst Client-side rendering optimizations

Goal: Map challenges to actionable fixes.

Preceding Question Prompting
Prompt: “Before retrying failed API calls, what timeout or backoff policies should apply?”

Goal: Protect system from infinite retry loops and ensure graceful degradation.

# Stage 5: Deployment and Continuous Improvement
Real-World Scenario Prompting
Prompt: “A cyclone alert has just been issued. How should the system prioritize and deliver location-based alerts?”

Goal:Ensure dynamic alert routing by user proximity, severity, and timing.

Straightforward Prompting
Prompt: “List 4 long-term growth strategies for a weather app post-deployment.”

Goal: Drive retention through feature enrichment and engagement loops.

# Tabular Format Prompting
Strategy Description Premium Subscription Unlock advanced forecasts & no ads Regional Language UI Increase accessibility across regions AI-Powered Insights Offer suggestions like “carry umbrella” Community Reporting User inputs to refine local predictions

Goal: Highlight scalable enhancement pathways.

### Preceding Question Prompting
Prompt: “Before launching in hilly or coastal regions, what terrain-specific forecasts must the system support?” Goal: Plan for elevation-based predictions, fog alerts, and landslide risk zones.

### Evaluation of Prompt Effectiveness
Accuracy & Depth
Prompting variety ensured detailed data capture—from user concerns to system specifications.

###  User-Centered Adaptability
Scenario and preceding prompts helped model actual user decision-making and needs.

### Agility & Flexibility
Structured prompts allowed quick iteration during architecture, testing, and rollout phases.

# Result:
This scenario-based report highlights how various prompting techniques can effectively guide different stages of project report development. From technical architecture to ethical concerns, tailored prompts allowed AI platforms to simulate real-life roles (e.g., architect, analyst) and generate relevant, structured, and creative outputs. Prompt diversity ensures completeness and quality in automated report writing, especially in complex, multi-disciplinary domains.
